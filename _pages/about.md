I'm a Ph.D. Engineering student at Indiana University. I'm a mental health advocate, aspiring engineering health expert, DJ/mixer by night and chicken tenders lover. I'm interested in engineering health, physiology, mental health, signal processing and social media. 

Prior to IU, I am an alumna of Pennsylvania State University, SEU and SUNY Buffalo. I have 10 years of academic experience in research and programming code. I am passionate about research, advocating for those who struggle with mental health and building software to impact our society in this domain. I want to utilize technology and build a solution. We can heal our past and build our future.
